// Compile-time stubs for the uGUI types this mod binds against, built into a
// UnityEngine.UI.dll reference stub by the build-deps script.
//
// These live in their own assembly and must stay there. The shipped
// UnityEngine.dll is a facade that type-forwards every engine MODULE type
// (Camera, Canvas, RectTransform, ...), so a stub that declares those in
// UnityEngine.dll still resolves at runtime. uGUI is a package, not a module:
// the real UnityEngine.dll carries no forwarder for the UnityEngine.UI
// namespace. Declaring Image/Graphic/Text in the UnityEngine stub emits typerefs
// to [UnityEngine]UnityEngine.UI.Image, which nothing can resolve, and every
// method touching one throws TypeLoadException at runtime.
